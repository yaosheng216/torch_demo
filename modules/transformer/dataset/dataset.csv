1,Even if it wont give one more than previous posts here like Ruby Liangs very good one i wanted to share my own point of view Hope my English is understandable Bon voyage is a rhythmic light but deep presentation of the French unorganized comedown but also courage and charm All along in a brilliantly reconstituted 1940 France with many details from Bordeaux luxurious hotel occupied by Government HQ and attacked by useless high class French to Parisian coffees near Le Pantheon  rue Mouffetard and 1930s cars Gérard Depardieu and Yvan Attal give their second roles a brilliant taste Isabelle Adjani and Virgnie Ledoyen are very credible in their drastically different roles and Grégori Derangère makes an bewitching performance Much lighter than average eg American war times movies and focused on the civilians Bon voyage shows a lot of things about french issues even to a French guy like me some of them quite deep
0,I could not believe the original rating I found when i looked up this film 95 Unfortunately it looks like I am not alone The film is slow and boring really one of the sad things is that if the film had been given a realistic rating of around 5 or 6 then the expectation would not have been so high Unfortunately this was not the case so when watching the film and seeing the poor story and acting I am left giving it a 310 score Vinnie Jones is superb in Lock stock and also Snatch and he plays a great hard man however he should stick to this role Its a bit like when Stallone and Schwarzenegger have done comedy films they just dont work Neither can he play lead actor he plays better as supporting or otherwise When he plays lead his acting talents are too in view and shown up as not really very good Mean Machine is another good example of this
0,Wowspeechless as to the making of this film I cant say much The coverbox at the local videostore shouldve said it allnothing but 6 actorsactresses who get lost on the set of Scream and decide to shoot a movie The acting was apparently not in the budget but they were able to afford nudity and goodlooking actors Style over substance almost makes its mark here except most of these actingclass failures keep forgetting that there is a plot that needs to go somewhere when they were reading this script After only 4 or 5 kills by the socalled masked murderer and a confusing tiein plot about a Murder Club which the dumb lead actress thinks is a real club that she can join only if she can get over a girl bumping into her car you want to stab your hands with the nearest sharp object to remind yourself never to get overly excited by a possibly good movie such as this I feel bad for the people who bought this film and cant find anyone to take it off their hands Another example of whats wrong with the growing number of straight to video horror releases with no thought put into the essentials Throw it away if you did buy this
1,Though derivative Labyrinth still stands as the highlight of the midhalf of the sixyearold show Finally a story allows Welling to show how he has grown as an actor Its not easy playing a character that is the embodiment of truth justice and the American way on a weekly basis with very little variation His performance permitting him to show how one might react if heshe discovers that all that he knew may be a lie was quite believable Welling rose to the occasion marvelously As always Michael Rosenbaum as the handicapped Lex delivered as did Kristen Kreuk as a toosweettobebelieved Lana Allison Mack the everpresent Chloe also scored as a slightly offherrocker version The use of an annoying hum in the background added to the tone of the installment and made for an engaging drama
1,I think if you were to ask most JWs whether they expect a miracle cure because of their faith you will find they do not I know I do not What you will find instead is that they believe the promises Christ made of a resurrection So even even if the worst were to happen and we die while holding onto our integrity Jehovah can and will correct this It really gets down to a simple question is God real to you or is this all just make believe If he is real and you trust him you will follow his directions no matter what the short term outcome may be I had a heart attack about a year and a half ago One in my family was horrified when she saw the words NO BLOOD written in large letters over my chart I reasoned with her that if I were in a position that only a blood transfusion would save my life would that be a good time to anger the only one could return me to life when the time came She didnt get it  God just isnt real enough to her Too bad I wish she could have the comfort a strong faith gives
1,Its also the best book Ive ever read Karl Urban and Steve Zahn are great together It had drama adventure and sweetness and sadness I laughed I cried Its hard not to laugh when Gus is talking I wish Gus would have smacked Clara like he did Inez Clara just lead Gus on all those years with no intentions of ever marrying him She just liked playing with him It was sad that he spent his whole life pining for her It would have been nice if Woodrow had married Maggie but she would have just died on him anyway Woodrow was a man that could not express his feelings and kept them bottled up It was obvious that he loved Maggie after the raid on Austin when the rangers got back and he ran to hold her Val Kilmer is excellent at playing odd characters I loved his portrayal of Captian Inish Skull I loved the whole Lonesome Dove saga Comanche Moon is the best of the bunch
0,Towards the end of the movie I felt it was too technical I felt like I was in a classroom watching how our Navy performs rescues at sea I liked seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers I guess I should have figured that out before but I never thought about it Using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is odd and not realistic The acting was pretty good since theyre mostly seasoned professionals but if youre going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen it should be more like a fantasy comical etc Everything was taken too seriously At least the movie had Felix Ungar as pilot with Buck Rogers the night stalker and Dracula also on board The movie was filled with well known faces I understand that Hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama but it does hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature Thats why I said it should have been more comical My pet peeve with movies about airline travel is that everybody just casually moves about They walk around with drinks setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later just as if theyre in a building or something and acting as if turbulence just doesnt exist Also I know its a disaster movie but suspense doesnt have to include a 30 second crash after hitting something Anyway the skilled actors and actresses keep this weak script from having been made into a movie that got canned after its first screening I like Lee Grant but it was fun to watch a psychotic person get decked
0,Yet another early film from Alfred Hitchcock which seems to have been done out of contractual obligation As with Juno and the Paycock you can tell that Hitchcock had little interest in this movie There is almost no style or craft to it at all The story revolves around Fred and Emily a young married couple who come into some money and go on a cruise which proves to be a test of their marriage Emily is given a chance at a new life with a good hearted wealthy man who falls in love with her but chooses to take the high road and stay with her husband This might seem more believable if Fred werent made out to be a completely insensitive pompous ass who jumps at the first opportunity he sees to leave his wife for another woman The couple ends up staying together but the movie lacks any real reconciliation scene The third act goes in a completely different direction with the couple stranded on an abandoned ship and rescued by an Asian fishing boat Joan Barry does give a very stirring performance as the faithful wife of an unfaithful husband Thats about all you can say for this one
0,I remember back when I was little when I was away at camp and we would campout under the stars There was always someone there that would have a good story to tell that involved the woods that surrounded us and they would always creep me out Well when I found Wendigo at the library I checked it out hoping to be one of those films that had a supernatural being haunting people in the woods much like the stories that were told at camp Well much to my dismay I was so far from the truth Wendigo is really bad The story starts of when a family of three is driving to their winter cabin which looks like your normal suburban home and nothing like a cabin in the woods and they run into a deer Well it seems the local rednecks were actually hunting this particular deer and are pretty upset at our city folk The movie spends far too much time following the families everyday activities instead of getting to the point of the film It wasnt until about the last 15 minutes that we actually have some action involving the wendigo My suggestion is that you stay very far away this film It will leave you wanting your hour and a half back
1,The sequel is exactly what you will expect it to be And it is good enough that everyone who would have wanted to watch this should leave it happy This is not a movie that will win an Academy award But it does take what made the Jackass TV show and original movie a success and it turns it up a notch It is funnier more brutal and more disgusting than the original And I loved every minute of it The original had a few notorious stunts and there is at least one stunt that this movie will be remembered for You will wince cringe look away and laugh very very hard In any event you probably do not need to read this review or any others to know if you will like this movie unless you have never heard of Jackass
1,OKso this film is NOT very well knownand wasnt very well publicisedI discovered this fairly brutal gangster gone good movie by complete accident on one of Skys millions of movie channels late on some boring eveningbut Im glad i didThe opening sequence to this film is fantastically comical in a very dark wayThis in fact sets what i think is the general tone for the movieI think a lot of critics and movie fans that have actually seen this film have been a bit unfair to just write it off as a lower budget gangster movie in the Reservoir Dogs veinOKso there are undeniable similarities between Thursday and some other crime genre films that it has been compared tobut in all fairnessi think this film takes a much more darkly comic look at this type of filmand the end result is a engrossingwell madefunnyif not totally original filmTom Jane is good in thisand deserves the recognition he will now hopefully get thanks to the The PunisherHis performance as the bad guy gone good is realisticfunny and just cold enough to make you believe Casey really was a bad ass before he reformedThats another thing that makes this film stand out for methe charactersIn Nicks gang you get the strangest trio of criminals ever assembleda smoothcharismatic but very cold leaderNicka trigger happy blood loving sexually predatory bitch of a womanDallasand a psychotic hill billy with brains with a penchant for tortureBilly HillThrow in the most bizarre police detective ever seen on screenbeautifully over played by Mickey Rourkeand youve got a recipe forwell for Thursday reallyIts at times darkly comicsometimes brutalsometimes unoriginalbut always engrossing and worth watching810
0,Granny directed by Boris Pavlovsky who sees eight friends experiencing a night of terror when a psychokiller dressed in a old hag rubber mask and a nightdress interrupts their party They say you cant judge a book by its cover but it appears that the same is not true of DVDs I was in the mood for a REALLY bad horror film last night and since the cover of Granny featured a shoddily photoshopped image of the titular killer swinging an axe terrible typography they even use the system font Sand a definite design nono and credits featuring absolutely noone I had heard of I reckoned it would be pretty lousy It was When a film clocks in at just under an hour long it really shouldnt waste too much time before getting to the action Granny however spends the first 20 minutes or so with its unlikable group of friends indulging in pointless games and extremely banal conversation Anyone who actually stays with the film long enough for the killing to begin and I doubt most sane people would bother will be treated to several dreadful death scenes featuring amateurish gore loads of awful acting and a surprise ending that comes as no surprise if youve seen April Fools Day then youll guess what the twist is way before it is revealed Granny is uninspired unexciting and almost unwatchable Avoid
1,This movie is a journey through the mind of a screenwriter caught in his own paradoxical philosophy He examines the ever illusive question of who am I and what is I Its a courageous and thought provoking enterprise There is a shipload of beautiful images dreaminspired Escherlike paradoxes reminiscent of the hand drawing itself or rather erasing itself More and more we follow the writer in his agony over what to say and what to film we see him phoning with his wife who left for Peru leaving him to take care of their baby a task he performs with less and less attention until hes so absorbed in his dilemmas that he hardly looks at the child anymore His wife comes back and makes a scene destroys his notes and helping him go over the last treshold until he erases himself Interspersed with eyepleasing and Idestructing images the story is mainly philosophical Its about the veils of Maya the world of illusion The paradox of the movie however is that it needs a lot of talking and thinking to prove that thinking should stop During the more than two hours of provocative beauty and rapid philosophising the movie made me long for silence or a shorter movie If that was the purpose of the maker he succeeded quite well
0,Intriguing premise should have been a 20 minute short Thats how long it would take his biological parents to think Hmm we lost one son and never found him who is about his age and he looks like our remaining son Oh yes and hes a runaway Hmm But no this is the most clueless family in history And the conclusion while trying to jerk tears manages only to induce more groans of disbelief
1,This working girls go to hell soap is a time capsule candidate courtesy of its immaculate physical production 50s costuming look at all those bows and pearls creamy Johnny Mathis theme song and ohso daring for its time sexual attitudes Rona Jaffes novel on which the film was based keeps on being republished and just a few years ago Vanity Fair actually devoted an article to this delectable bon bon of a movie Take a look at the new DVD transfer and youll know why The three leads  Hope Lange Diane Baker and Suzy Parker  echo the girls from How to Marry A Millonaire or Carrie Bradshaw and her friends from Sex and the City Gentlewomen songsters off on a spree Their romantic adventures and sexual entanglements are the stuff of paperback passion empty caramel corn calories devoid of nutrition impossible to resist snacking on Lange is genuinely touching in her neoGrace Kelly way Baker is properly dim and idealistic as a timid virgin who gets gasp knocked up by a hiss cad It helps that the cad is played by Robert Evans the throaty voiced coke snorting film mogul who surely has lead many an innocent young lamb to the slaughter in his Beverly Hills bedroom Suzy Parker is fascinating in the first half of the film all blithe self assurance and knowing remarks She struts her stuff with the panache of the fashion icon she was in the 50s Alas shes not up to where the film sends her into madness and obsession But she exudes glamour and savior faire and her acting is at least adequate One wonders why the critics loathed her virtually driving her out of movies a few years later Perhaps an aloof attitude on the part of a good looking woman is just too much to bear It sank Ali McGraws career a generation later and when you think of it Ali McGraw and Suzy Parker were basically the same actress The films only major flaw is a weak ending It pretty much collapses into a romantic swoon at the end rather than rising to a wham bang melodramatic finish like the other famous soap opera from producer Jerry Wald Peyton Place which had Lana Turner weeping and gnashing her teeth during a rape trial Here Hope Lange wanders out onto the New York sidewalk spots burly eternally hung over but now of course sober Stephen Boyd and they simply walk off togetherinto the sunset one presumes Otherwise this is pretty much the definition of a guilty pleasure Oh Yestheres also Joan Crawford breathing fire at all the young girls and smoking cigarettes while she hisses to her married lover over the phone And the titles are done in hot pink with ribbon lettering that recalls the department store ads of the late 50s Dont miss
1,Anatomie Anatomy is an entertaining and engaging film that falls short of delivering the discomfort that should be connected with the films subject matter The idea of ethical ignorance in the medical science world is one that pushes the viewer towards discomfort and the realism of the institutions Heidelberg and the special effects make it a notentirely easy film to watch However the characters the script and the gloss of the film all seem too familiar with the Scream movies that repopularised this sort of genre Sadly then whilst the subject is one to care about the viewer is presented with another movie full of college student characters that we dont really get a chance to care about unresolved subplots and hammy stagekillings that have been reinventing themselves since the memorable Drew Barrymore opening scene in Scream several years back Steven Ruzowillzky makes a fair effort of the script and the direction but pushes no boundaries other than the general theme Whilst we are presented with an entertaining film with some reasonable performances we are unfortunately left with the old feeling nothing is wrong with this film but nothing is extraordinary either An entertaining film and an interesting chance to see how foreign filmmakers have been influenced by the postscream horror culture 6 out of 10
1,I just read the comments of TomReynolds2004 and feel I have to jump in here I understand he doesnt like the film but his reasons are not evident My feeling regarding this film is that it is not afraid to travel the darker roads of loneliness failure disappointment and sorrow Each of these two people as portrayed have plenty of reasons to be bitter and angry yet find tenderness and comfort in each the other Only great acting could make this work without becoming an emotional quagmire sentimental and sappy I really became interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity given to them by such strong performances I have every reason to dislike Jane Fonda for her Vietnam era actions but personal feelings apart she is fabulous in this role Robert DeNiro is superb as a man whose intelligence and goodness begins to fail him in a world indifferent to his abilities This is the first I have seen DeNiro using tenderness rather than toughness to sell a character and I really like it This film was a big surprise when I first viewed it and I look forward to seeing it again
0,Might end up being the biggest disappointment that I will see in 2009 I seem to be the rare person who disliked Parks Oldboy but I think that his Lady Vengeance and Sympathy for Mr Vengeance are among the best films Ive seen in the 2000s decade Therefore I really was looking forward to see this especially as it got such positive reviews Instead I found the film clichéd and broke little if any new ground to the vampire genre And while I can appreciate a bit of gallows humor in movies like this I felt Park did this at very inopportune times Others have comparedcontrasted this to Let the Right One In and I have to say that Let the Right One In was far superior to this one and was a fresh take on the vampire genre Sadly Parks take was a tired one
0,Kind of hard to believe that the movie from this book could succeed in topping its awfulness The plot is so contrived and unbelievable   starting with laying a ton of guilt on a small child to spare her pain Then we have the collusive behavior of at least six and maybe more peopleincluding clergy involved in what is a crime everywhere Next we have a wife who seemingly in the length of a ferry ride goes from being comparatively happy to very shortly kicking over the traces A very unpleasant and coo coo mother aided abetted and supported by a politically correct group of friends Moving the setting from an island off the coast of South Carolina did not help the story although it may have helped the film makers budget The very beautiful buildings supposedly housing the monastery did not seem to logically suit an island small enough to need golf carts and such a small ferry service Kim Basinger whom I do really like is painfully thin in this movie and her hairdo certainly belongs in another decade Also there is simply no chemistry at all between her and either of the male leads I thoroughly disliked the book from which this was taken but did read it all The movie I kept surfing back and forth to had to leave whenever that saccharine music got too much Unless you like an unbelievable story wooden acting a contorted mixture of religiousmythologicalallegory my advice is to skip this one Oh and maybe a small carping criticism but wouldnt a caring father have a life jacket on a small child on a small boat The best part of this movie is the scenery
0,There is absolutely NO reason to waste your time with this film The original said it all and still holds up Either read the book or do some research about the story and youll realize this remake is ludicrous Eric Roberts as Perry Smith His sister could have done a better job Having been to Holcomb  Edgerton KS where the story takes place the sets and locations looked NOTHING like Kansas The original is riveting from the location filming to the use of the actual participants weapons and victims belongings Unforgettable performances by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake Soundtrack by Quincy Jones and cinematography by Conrad HallThe original is available on DVD in widescreen now Let this turkey die a quick death
0,A painfully protracted maudlin and predictable drama my twentyfifth Sidney Lumet film Garbo Talks gets filed precipitously on the low quality end of my quest The film documents a harried young working man named Gilbert Ron Silver who is son to Estelle Rolle Anne Bancroft eccentric feisty and above all an obsessive fan of Greta Garbo When Estelle becomes afflicted with a brain tumor her son decides to go on an obsessive quest of his own track down Greta Garbo and bring her to his mother Anne Bancroft is in fullon chewthescenery AuntieMame mode here that kind of feisty ol gal that film loves where she mouths off to people and stands up for her ideals and ends up in jail all the time She stands outside of the film as an obvious artificial construct and every scene with her is yukyuk lame every note striking false The rest of the characters are equally as onedimensional but tremendously lessinteresting Ron Silver is flat as can be and his attempted love triangle is as telegraphed as anything else in the film He is dating affluent Lisa Rolfe Carrie Fisher but becomes smitten with oddball coworker Jane Mortimer Catherine Hicks and I called every scene three scenes before they happen Thats the other problem Onedimensional characters can survive if they are posited in an intriguing and captivating story but theres simply nothing here The films pace is glacial resplendent with extraneous material that strengthens absolutely nothing and when the film does begin to follow a linear plot its both plodding and uninteresting There are plenty of guest stars so to speak including Harvey Fierstein as a gay New Yorker imagine that in yet another highly inessential scene Late in the film it attempts to make a halfwaydecent statement on the nature of idolatry and its role in our lives but by that time none of the characters exist as real people and the film had bored me into submission so it functions as a case of fartoolittle fartoolate The film is my twentyfifth Lumetdirected film making him easily my mostviewed director but outside of a couple egregious misses A Stranger Among Us anyone he hasnt plumbed the painfully uninteresting depths of Garbo Talks Grade 4510 CC  21 of 24 of 1984  23 of 25 Lumet films
1,This movie is simply awesome It is so hilarious Although the skating and other montages are played out the comedy is awesome Raab Himself and Brandon Dicamillo are hilarious There will be moments when you cant breath youre laughing so hard Plus there are scenes that you can watch hundreds of times and still laugh This is one of the funniest comedies Ive ever seen
1,Many of the reviewers have made it a point to note that Pinjar is unlike the run of the mill films produced in Bollywood While this is true Bollywood films in general are geared to a specific audience and should be appreciated for accomplishing their aims in this regard HoweverPinjar is an excellent film for those seeking a change from the normal equation based Bollywood film Set during the time of Partition between India and Pakistan Pinjar focuses on a Punjabi girl who becomes the victim of societal and cultural attitudes toward the treatment of women in her time Paro the protagonist is forced to choose between a life with a man who has abducted her and the fleeting hope of a life with her family back in Indian ruled Punjab More than an issue of Hindus and Muslims Pinjar addresses and defines a womans role as a daughter as a wife and as a mother in India and Pakistan in 1947 Unlike typical Bollywood films which are escapist in nature Pinjar is a film that makes its audience contemplate these issues during and after the film
1,Lets set one thing straight this movie does not seek to redefine the genre its not Dr Strangelove o Young Frankenstein Its a silly flick with three great female leads cant remember any other comedy with similar characteristics Rachel Dracht and Amy Poehler from SNL and indie queen Parker Posey charming as ever The story is basic the three gals were losers in college and are still after wards it Poehler is a dog trainer who cant even get a date with a blind guy Posey is an assistant for a senator who hasnt been touched by a man since Clinton was in office i catched that one several minutes later im a little slow OK and Dracht has a gay fiancée Seth Meyers from SNL funny They have to prevent the uncool daughter of the senator the always cute Amber Tamblyn from the TV series Joan of Arcadia to embarrass her during spring break So of course they have to go to watch over her and some hilarity ensues All in all a light simple comedy quite short and quite enjoyable
0,Reba sucks It sucks hard Its about this awful country singer attempting comedy They might as well call this show Generic because thats what it is Its dumb and generic Reba youre not funny and Im glad your retarded show was cancelled because you suck and so does Brock Barbra Jean the redheaded teenager that jockey guy and the 12 year old who got knocked up You all suck and none of you are funny Oh and I heard a rumor that Reba is actually a gay devilworshipper who idolizes Hitler and tortures animals And she puts subliminal messages on her show and in her music in hopes to make children kill their parents and kill themselves But it was just a rumor Anyway this is the worst show ever Reba is gay I do not like her I think The Office is better than this show and this show sucks
0,Great actors good filming a potentially interesting plot and what should have been good dialog Nothing else is good about this movie Perhaps the writer or director thought they could make a thought provoking film out of annoying characters who are as deep as a cup of coffee  Within 10 minutes I disliked the portrayal of Kim by Caroleen Feeney so much that it became a distraction While Kim is supposed to be an unsympathetic character I am not sure I was supposed to want to commit acts of physical violence upon her The first of many bizarre things that happen is that Wes David Strathairn goes from I am missing 5000 to She stole 50 in about 3 seconds It was quite implausible since she Kim never had access to his wallet nor was she a master pickpocket there simply was no rational reason to suspect her Most people have lostmisplaced money and assume just that we LOST it Same goes for Kim later All very unrealistic behavior in what is supposed to be I think a look at real people The character of Kim was at minimum suffering from a BiPolar disorder Wes had huge inadequacy issues Nancy was just boring and Matt was delusional particularly about music I actually turned this off about 23 of the way through However to write a valid comment I forced myself to turn it back on hoping that something would come together in this movie No sorry it was still bad Make it a point to miss this one
0,The second half of Steven Soderberghs revolutionary bio on Che Guevara deals with his last campaign to export revolution to Bolivia In order to maintain his saintly visage of Che Soderbergh conveniently leap frogs the mass executions he presided over after the revolution in Cuba and the folly of his Congo adventure This is the history of a failure he writes in the preface of his Congo Journal to concentrate fully on Ches attempt to rally support to rise up against the government in Bolivia It would turn out to be a disaster and Guevaras final act What plagued the first chapter follows suit here as Soderbergh slows his film to a crawl to study the beatific countenance of the contemplative Guevara once again being played like James Dean in East of Eden by Bernicio Del Toro The problem is Guevara has little success in gaining converts and he soon finds himself and his starving comrades being swallowed up in the heart of darkness Bolivian Jungle Unlike Werner Herzog in the magnificent Aguirre the Wrath of God Soderbergh fails to utilize the jungles metaphorical possibilities to heighten the desperation of the guerrillas He seems more concerned with keeping Ches nimbus above his head than exploring the panic setting in on the dead enders There is one Herzogian moment where Che sits astride an obstinate horse kicking and screaming to get it moving but overall Soderberghs mise en scene remains flat sloppy and uninteresting  In both of his films Soderbergh shows he is clearly a Che groupie and because of it his focus remains myopic and narrow He spends too much time building his monument to Che and too little in developing his relationships with key players in his saga especially Fidel Castro Making matters worse he does it with a slow and dispassionate approach that never catches fire One would think he was steeped in enough Eisenstein and Vertov to realize that sweeping change is showcased a lot better with sweeping style
1,I had the opportunity to see this film twice at the 2006 Moving Picture Festival In Birmingham Alabama I enjoyed it so much that I watched it a second time when they had an encore screening When I think of the films that are shown at festivals I usually expect them to be edgy and offbeat often with the feel of an elaborate student project Theres nothing wrong with these types of projects of course and I enjoy the unique styles of independent films but sometimes I want to see a more mainstream approach to independent filmmaking By mainstream I mean more like a film produced for national release  In other words a movie that you would see in a regular movie theater The writing directing cinematography casting and acting in this movie are all totally pro There is nothing typically independent about this film As an aspiring director I am always looking for movies that will motivate me to stop procrastinating and push harder to get my career going This is one of those films As I watched The Big Bad Swim my motivation level was incredible I felt like my adrenaline had kicked in The reason I felt this way was because I was so impressed with every aspect of this production I left the theater excited and ready to start writing that long putoff project When a movie makes me feel like that I know its really good This is the first featurelength project from Ishai Setton and I found myself wishing that It had been my project For me thats really rare See this film Its beautifully shot and directed and the casting is excellent Paget Brewster delivers a very believable and likable performance She has a quality about her a charisma that really draws you in and keeps you focused on her any time she is on screen She makes you feel like you know her personally as a friend Thats a gift I think the industry is really missing out by not utilizing her acting abilities more often Jeff Branson and Jess Weixler also did topnotch jobs I can not say enough nice things about The Big Bad Swim I look forward to future projects from all of those involved in its production
0,This is beyond a shadow of a doubt the absolute worst movie I have ever seen Its been a long time since Ive seen it but the jokes are NOT funny the plot is painfully forseeable calling the main characters stupid is to vastly upgrade their intelligenceuggh I just wanted to punch Tom Arnold and make him cry because he wasted two hours of my life when I was done watching this piece of cinematic filth I dont even know why I ever wanted to watch it but remember if you see this movie DONT SAY I DIDNT WARN YOU PS Tom Arnolds character sings a song in this movie called Im My Own Grandfather Nuff said
1,Excellent plot within a plot within a plot Shame about two of my film heroes having a good snog Must be my upbringing Very well acted by all You never quite know whos going to outdo who The last little twist at the end allows for all to get their just deserts Recommend to all A harmless tongue in cheek thriller which if it has any faults is probably Michael Caines overuse of the word bloody but thats his signature isnt it 910
0,Well what can I say there are BGrade Movies and there are BGrade Movies and this definitely falls into the latter However since its obvious that even the makers of the film know that its not a credible movie take a look at the closing credits it can be forgiven The plot is basically a convicted psycho killer is killed He accidentally has his genetic material mixed up with some experimental acid that get combined and then lost in the snow The killer now takes on the form of a snowman  if you can believe that The snowman Jack Frost is after the country town Sherif who put him behind bars In doing so Jack Frost ends up killing half the town This movie lacks any real scares and the effects alone remind me of the BGrade movies of the 50s This alone makes it worth watching for a laugh A movie to pass the time away
0,Well well at last a view of this underrated flick But you cant find a good copy of it terrible copy full with green drops the editing isnt syncronized the sound do has sometimes that terrible hiss and sometimes you even can hear the camera recording Overall its too dark a waist of time you should say but it isnt Its a bit slow the first half part of the movie its all talking and making love to each other It is even still weird that the girls in movies from the 60s never wear any bras When they enter the sleeping room its full glory Anyway banned in the UK since 84 and still on the video nasties list The reason is simple its gory for their time being It really has some nasty dismemberements and its creepy in some way due the fact that it is filmed handycam way So every shot the image is moving things they do these days with the steadycam The Ghastly Ones could have been better if the quality of the film was better but still better then other films of the time like Schoolgirls In Chains
0,THE RAP the book this movie was based on was one of the most difficult books Ive ever read Yet I could not put it down Raunchy crude foul lewdyou name it it had it It also had some of the best characterizations of any novel Ive ever read Well as for the flickit was deplorable I mean Tim Mcintire as Wasco Wasco was the baddest muthatalking bout WASCOMcintire as Wasco is like casting Tim Conway as Charles Manson What happened to the MAIN character in the book Little Arv He doesnt even exist in the movieFast Walking WAS NOT the main dude in the book Why even name credit this thing with THE RAP None of the spirit atmosphere nastiness or drama of the book was captured in this movie For me it was not only a disappointment but a total waste of time and celluloid
0,Dr Chopper starts shortly after teenager Nicholas Robert Adamson mum has died he is still cut up about it but every cloud has a silver lining  in this case it appears that his mum owns a log cabin at Lake Tatonka the self proclaimed friendly place for happy people that she didnt tell him about So Nicholas together with his girlfriend Jessica Chelsey Crisp  three friends Jimmy Butch Hansen Reese Chase Hoyt  Tamara Ashley McCarthy head out there for a fun weekend Unfortunately things dont go according to plan the cabin turns out to be little more than a run down shed  their neighbours turn out to be Dr Chopper Ed Brigadier  his two nurses who go around killing anyone they meet to use them in horrible experiments Going straighttovideoDVD Dr Chopper was edited  directed by Lewis Schoenburn  this film seems to be having a hard time here on the IMDb with some pretty harsh reviews while I think Dr Chopper as a horror film is pretty worthless I dont think some of the criticism Ive read is entirely justified The script which takes itself very seriously is credited to Ian Holt whether he likes it or not who has a role in the film as Detective Crocker according to the IMDb cast list although I cant remember any character of that name maybe he was one of the cops at the start Anyway the basic story is alright I suppose although its a tad dull  lasts for too long its typical slasher fare with some sort of evil character running around bumping off our annoying American teen cast you know the drill by now Besides some brief  undeveloped nonsense about Dr Chopper using body parts to replenish his own deteriorating body theres not much story here  the script seems to exist solely to invent situations for girls to take their tops off theres the inevitable sex scenes theres a sequence where some girls have to complete a sorority house initiation topless  theres even a couple of lesbians here as well one of whom is seen without her full compliment of clothing Oh  when I say topless I mean they arent wearing any tops but they all keep their bras on so you may want to bear in mind there isnt any actual full frontal nudity in Dr Chopper at all So there you have it really its an average story that has a mildly surprising twist at the end which is wasted is populated with poor clichéd dumb characters that exist only to showcase some cheap gore scenes  girls in bras To be honest I expect a little bit more from my films but then again maybe Im just being picky Director Schoenburn does OK actually this is by no means the worst looking film Ive seen although it still looks cheap Theres no style here I didnt think it was scary  theres no atmosphere either The gore is restrained  restricted to some dead bodies  severed limbs theres nothing new here or any particularly convincing special effects Dr Chopper is also one of those films where character decisions  motivations are ridiculous Technically this is a little rough around the edges but is reasonably well made on what was probably a really low budget the forest locations are suitably isolated although the cops office looks like someones front room  the two nurses outfits at the start look like stripper outfits The acting is alright it could have better but Ive certainly seen worse Dr Chopper indeed features a doctor who rides around on a chopper motorbike but unfortunately that just isnt enough to satisfy me despite it being a reasonably competent production the lack of any real gore nudity or a decent plot sinks it without trace
1,Daniel DayLewis is the most versatile actor alive English aristocratic snob in A Room With a View passionate Irish thief in In the Name of the Father an impudent violent butcher in Gangs of New York in a performance ten times stronger than Adrian Brodys in the Pianist and as the outrageous Cristy Brown with cerebral palsy in My Left Foot just to name a few His roles all influence eachother but each is seperate and utterly unique He changes completely with each character he takes on And Im beginning to believe that he can act as anything Anything As Cristy Brown he is stunning He does not ridicule the character and he does not pity the character A difficult achievement And Cristy Brown comes to life A smart man An outrageous man Human This movie despite small scenetransition faults and the like is an inspiration Yes its predictable But is it stupidly sentimental No I laughed I cried Not a single moment of cheese Proof that this isnt a Hollywood movie My favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant when Cristy is discussing painters with Eileen Peter and her friends Heres where Daniel DayLewis reaches an acting climax Ill kick you in the only part of your anatomy thats animated Wheel out the cripple And his performance never slows down never falters and is beautiful Simply He has a lot of screen time here I watch it again again and I never get tired of Cristys perspicacious eyes twitching and guttural speeches A mustsee Fo sho yo
0,That is quite an outdated movie which aims to showcase the youths yearning for freedom in some dehumanizing British school Oh yes its like in the army you learn to obey and do what youre asked to Yes the young dream of something else but it breaks their dreams and sweeps away their optimism on the threshold of life Great Basically thats how you could sum up the nice intentions in If Nice intentions that arouses no cinematographic challenges the result is a declamatory movie Do you see how boring I mean At least that oldie helped Kubrick cast McDowell in A Clockwork Orange a movie with a truly powerful social satire and no selfindulgent sentimentalism
0,the only reason i bought this DVD is because cynthia rothrock is in itnow everybody knows she is the queen of martial arts b moviesthe trouble is this is not a martial arts moviecynthia rothrock has about a minute or so of fight scenes in this stupid movienow if you were a film maker and you had cynthia rothrock in your movie wouldnt you want to have a lot of martial arts action all she does in this movie is walk around looking bored just like i was when i watched this pile of crapi own a lot of her movies and they are all b movies but at least they had some cool fight scenes in themif you are a martial arts fan avoid this no matter whatim still mad i wasted 4 dollars to buy this DVD
1,Hey there Army Sgt Im sorry dude but being a SGT in the Army and being in the Army National Guard does not make you qualified to comment on a Marine movie You are not a Marine and just because you wear a uniform doesnt mean you can relate to being a Marine We simply are the best we have the hardest training yes we have big heads about ourselves but hey when you are the best you like to strut your stuff I was in the Iraq invasion and in Fallujah I fought next to soldiers You are not qualified to say anything about my Marine Corps I hate to be the one that starts the whole which branch is better but you have no right to say you are qualified to judge a Marine movie Oh yeahwe are Drill Instructorsnot Drill SGTs Thats the biggest clue you have no idea about what you are talking about Yeah we do not curse at recruits anymore Tell me how is cussing at someone going to make them a better Marine How will me hitting someone make a Marine a better Marine Yes it is a kinder boot camp from what I went through But we are dealing with different times and people We are training people who are over all smarter than our generations recruits We want smarter recruits not meaner And anyone who signs up to be a Marine in the first place has a dedication to be the best his country has to offer We dont have to reinforce that in Bootcamp Marines come to Bootcamp wanting to be killers We dont need to teach them that by demoralizing them by swearing at them and beating them At least that is how I feelAnd yes I am qualified to say that I have been on the battlefield numerous times and I have trained Marines and Recruits who eventually ended up on the battlefield But then again what do I know I was just there done that got the tshirt SGT of the Armyget a clue
1,Very Slight Spoiler  This movie despite being only on TV is absolutely excellent I didnt really pay attention to the differences in looks or accents so I cant really comment on that The acting in this was so good I had to pinch myself and say Remember its only a movie this DIDNT REALLY HAPPEN As I sat and listened to Harris and Quinn talk I knew that it was exactly what John and Paul would be talking about had they actually had this meeting The offhanded comments and burns from John were right on with his characterespecially in the restaurant as was his depression while Paul was very easy going and laid back Both actors did and excellent job and I was thrilled to have seen this movie Its a wicked experience for any Beatles fan And prepare for a few surprises
0,This production has absolutely no storyline The acting is embarrassing The promising Dutch television Sophie Hilbrand star should not add this movie to her CV Her acting is far from flawless and personally I think she has crossed boundary of professional decency relating to the way she exposes herself in this movie This movie contains too much unnecessary nudity vulgar sexual scenes and rude language It also shows a wrong image of the Netherlands as most movies do Do not bother to watch this movie a waste of time a waste of money and an embarrassing record for Hilbrand who has proved to be better with her close on on the screen
1,A lumberman finds a young cougar in need of help To young to be on his own the cat soon takes up with the rugged camp workers Nicknamed Good Time Charlie his antics amuse everyone at first His wild nature eventually begins to cause trouble and reintroducing him into his natural habitat becomes an issue This film is among those wonderful Disney nature films that were common in the 50s and 60s Lots of action beautiful scenery and some endearing animal to charm you These films were not long but included fascinating glimpses into wildlife and the effects of human contact Unlike Disneys animated talking animals the animals in these films remained true to their own nature They also make great travel films for seeing the western states
1,The Hospital is a movie that was made ahead of its time This film produced by screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky who gave us the OscarWinning film Network deals with overworked staff gross incompetence and bureaucratic corruption at a large conglomerate hospital in Manhattan George C Scott in a superb performance as the head physician is driven to alcoholism and a deathwish as he tries to recover from a divorce throwing his son out of the house and worst of all a medical facility where corruption and incompetence take precedence over caring and healing of the sick and injured Mr Scott makes the movie his own and viewers will be shocked at what they observe at this medical establishment You can feel the pain pun intended of what this hospital has done to him The vivid images of this hospitals incompetence are so vivid and dramatically powerful that you may find yourself laughing and being deeply disturbed from scene to scene If only the film had stayed with that premise in a documentary style fashion as it starts out this picture would be brilliant Unfortunately there is a subplot of Scott falling for the daughter of a senile patient The patient has been murdering people at the hospital This is where credibility of the picture becomes strained The romantic dialog scenes add nothing to the picture and the mental patient posing as a doctor I found to be totally unbelievable A simple security call and records check should have prevented the senile patient from doing the killings It takes almost the whole movie before security people are brought into the film to get the patient out of the hospital I could not see ONE PERSON doing that much damage even as corrupt as this hospital is Furthermore George C Scotts character is overworked another pun intended because the script has too many things happening at once For example within a period of 20 minutes you could have as many as 20 different doctors accused and denying what they should have done or didnt do With the nurses and aids its the same story Someones chart was read wrong someone was given the wrong medication and died the doctor operated on the wrong patient than another doctor does the same thing blaming a third nurse who was not on call because the second nurse who was supposed to be admitting the patient was on her coffee break There is also a lot of subtle dark humor with the same messages of incompetence and corruption being fed to the viewer This repetition of medical ineptness is unforgettable However the murder subplot is a distraction more than a help to this movie When the focus of this film is on the incompetence of the staff and Scotts reactions to this you are glued to the screen But the conversations between Scott and the mad patients daughter force the film into a mystery type Who Done it scenario that seriously hurts the quality of the movie When the loony patient is revealing how he did the killings I wondered the following Why did the producers need the find the killer madpatient subplot I think the only point of Scotts character having a relationship with the senile patients daughter was to give him anybody with whom to communicate The Hospital should have maintained its scathing indictment of the medical profession by removing the loveinterest and mad patient scenes It should have focused on the incompetent BS within its walls more frequently In an era where this movie could have been phenomenal the subplot stories make the film very good instead of the great masterpiece it could have been
1,Okay I didnt get the Purgatory thing the first time I watched this episode It seemed like something significant was going on that I couldnt put my finger on This time those Costa Mesa fires on TV really caught my attention and it helped that I was just writing an essay on Inferno But let me see what HASNT been discussed yet A TWOP review mentioned that Tony had 7 flights of stairs to go down because of the broken elevator Yeah 7 is a significant number for lots of reasons especially religious but heres one more for ya On a hunch I consulted wikipedia and guess what Dante divided into 7 levels Purgatorio Excluding antePurgatory and Paradise The stuff at the bottom of the stairs and what Tony cant get to  On to the allegedly random monkslap scene As soon as the monks appeared it fit perfectly in place with Tony trying to get out of Purgatory You can tell he got worried when that Christian commercial death disease and sin came on and hes getting more and more desperate because Christian heaven is looking kinda iffy for him By the time he meets the monks hes thinking hey maybe these guys can help me which sounds like contemplating other religions eg Buddhism and wondering if some other path could take him to salvation Not that Tony is necessarily literally thinking about becoming a Buddhist but it appears Finnerty tried that and messed up That slap in the face basically tells Tony theres no quick fix as in no you cant suddenly embrace Buddhism and get out of here  Tony was initially not too concerned about getting to heaven But at the conference entrance he realizes thats not going to be so easy for him At first I saw the name vs drivers license problem as Tony having led sort of a double life what with the killing people and sleeping around that he kept secret from most people He feels free to have an affair with quasiMelfi because hes Kevin Finnerty He figures out that he CAN fool some people with KFs cards like hotel receptionists but it wont get him out of Purgatory Those helicopters the helicopters of Heaven are keeping track of him and everything he does After reading all the theories on inFinnerty though it seems like KFs identity is a reminder of the infinite different paths Tony couldve taken in his life Possibly along with the car joke involving Infinitis that made no sense to me otherwise Aaaand at that point my brain fizzles out
0,This movie is bad Just bad In absolute terms bad  The dialog jumps off the screen and slugs you in the face with its thoroughly artificial banter and then defecates on your ability to detect even trace amounts of subtlety  Racism is bad Racism in Los Angeles can be especially bad I live in the city of Angels I can attest to that What is so terrible about the bigotry in Los Angeles is its insidious nature It creeps at you with a knowing glance or a swallowed word Until just at the edge of a full on fistfight It almost never comes right out and says why did he have to be black  I can see quite clearly that the carjackers are black the detectives partner is hispanic the DA is white As long as there is film rolling through the projector I can let the visuals music and words take me to that conclusion without just telling me the conclusion Characters emote and we read between the lines to make the connections and conclusions  That is a partnership and trust between filmmaker and audience That trust is raped by this movie  A good film pulls you in directions as an audience and it steers you with cues to drive to a point This movie beats you down with its point and insults you and your intelligence along the way My unanswered question is why did we as a society say collectively thank you
1,so halfway through the season i got so caught up in school and my activities that i didnt realize that the show had been canceled halfway through which is crap i think the followers of this show should write fox and ask them to at least finish filming so that a the season can be released on DVD later maybe then theyll see how many people were disappointed that the show didnt survive its first season i loved the show and looked forward to it every thursday after the OC can you imagine my disappointment when i came back to try and watch the show only to discover that it had disappeared needless to say im not very happy with fox right now even more so after discovering that NO ENDING WAS FILMED i mean if youre going to work on a project at least finish it to see what happens a half filmed show is like a half made car its pretty much useless fox film the damn ending and give some of the shows fans some peace
0,Ive seen about a half dozen of the low budget poverty row B westerns that Ken Maynard made in the 1930s and I am consistently amazed at how poor an actor he was How did he ever get to be a leading cowboy actor They say that he could ride pretty well back in the silents but he doesnt do anything particularly impressive in these later sound films Still maybe he got the leads because he was big and could ride Phantom Rancher isnt as bad as some of the other Ken Maynard films Ive seen but it still isnt much Some of the other characters refer to him a couple of times as a young fella where it appears to me that hes just as old as the other older actors And if thats not silly enough theres a rather significant script problem in this film At one point one of the characters makes a remark about how the phantom had prevented the poisoning of a well something that hadnt happened yet Just a couple of minutes later we then see that particular scene No it wasnt a flashback At first I thought perhaps that when Treeline Films was doing the DVD transfer they might have reversed two of the reels But in those days film reels contained approximately 11 minutes of film and the whole reversal only took about 3 or 4 minutes tops Everything else was in a logical order So it looks like that was a genuine continuity problem in the original film Maybe thats one reason why Colony Pictures didnt last very long
0,I went out of my way to get this film and was fortunate to get it on VHS Being a big Gloria Grahame fan it was an excellent addition to my collection Other than that I really cannot say a lot to recommend this picture The plot is predictable and weak and the only interesting aspect of the film is watching Sterling Hayden get into deeper trouble with his own department Ms Grahame is always fun to watch if you like her as I do but the dubbing of her singing hurts this picture a lot She works in a dive so let her use her own voice It can only lend to the atmosphere I must agree with an earlier reviewer the ending borrows heavily from THE BIG HEAT To the point of detracting from the ending I have seen worse films with Ms Grahame MACAO but I will never pass the opportunity to see her on screen If you are having a movie night and looking for a second feature film this is your movie Enjoy the picture
0,This film although not totally bad should have been filmed where the actual events took place Grand Island Nebraska was devastated by no less than seven tornados on the night of June 3 1980 Grand Island is situated in the nearly treeless flat Platte River Valley in Hall county The makers of this movie filmed in the tree covered hills of Ontario and moved the whole event to a nonexistant town called Blainsworth The people of Grand Island bravely survived this awful night only to be forgotten because of a poorly made movie
1,Over the years Ive watched this movie many times from seeing it on HBO and I now own a copy on DVD I must say its very memorable and entertaining in the meantime its interesting and educational too As any TV fan can relate to the time of the early 90s when the time came up to replace Johhny Carson the TV living legend of The Tonight Show whos it gonna be Jay or Dave This original film from HBO The Late Shift stays true to form and depicts the real events very well showing the behind the scenes battle between networks heads of NBC and CBS and even ABC they were all fighting for the services of Jay and Dave The acting makes it seem real as very little actual TV footage is shown with real life people as the actors portraying Leno and Letterman make it seem so real I havent read the Bill Carter book so I dont know if it stayed true to the pages but I have highly enjoyed this film over the years From the moment when it starts showing CBS entertainment heads watching Leno sub for Johhny and they decide they want to get in on the late night game Yet when Carson announces his unexpected retirement NBC wants to stay loyal with Leno yet conflict arrives when Letterman wants a crack at the slot at 1130 too It was fun to watch the wacky meeting with Michael OvitzTreat Williamswho makes all networks want to consider Letterman for a show It was interesting to see the scene of Johhny telling Letterman by phone in a direct way to walk from NBC and consider CBS And by the way Rich Little was terrific as Johhny Carson his portrayal couldnt be matched And plenty of tense moments were provided by showing the bickering and firing of Lenos talent manager Helen which NBC heads pressured him to do Overall great film that showed what TV is really like and it proves that networks are power and money hungry while showing thats its a cutthroat business Clearly theres no business like show business Great work from HBO very memorable and a watch anytime it showed the true story of the late night wars
0,Firstly I am not easily scared by Anything except for my few phobias but this movie is absolutely horrific This is not appropriate for children at all I had my mouth open the whole time it just shocked me I Couldnt believe how gory it was for a childrens movie bunnies being brutally murdered Its just unnecessary to be so horrifying and be rated G I recommend being over 8 to see this But dont get me wrong it was probably a good movie if I wasnt scarred mentally as a child I cannot believe a parent would allow a lets say 4 year old child to watch this Its just to intense and complicated not to forget gory for young kids Im wayy over 4 and I was shocked by the violence I dont recommend
1,For those who think of Dame May Witty as the kindly slightly batty old lady from Hitchcocks The Lady Vanishes this movie requires an adjustment Here shes anything but kindly or batty Instead her son George Macready is the loony one Just dont give him a knife otherwise his eyes light up and no furniture cushion in the house is safe Now we know what he has in mind for the trapped Nina Foch if he can just get out from under Mothers domineering hand Really tight little womanindanger film that keeps the suspense on high throughout The script never strays from Fochs dilemma Shes held prisoner in a big old Gothic house on the edge of an angry sea Theyre going to kill her but why Her predicament makes no sense The tension mounts as she tries one escape ploy after another but even strangers seem against her We begin to feel her helplessness and mounting paranoia as the world turns away from her Director Joseph H Lewis took a big step toward cult status with this film and understandably so Then too watch Foch run subtly through a gamut of emotions without once going over the top Witty too shines as a really intimidating matriarch who knows what she wants and how to get it if she can just keep her wacko son in line My one reservation is the climax which seems too contrived considering the timing of the events Nonetheless its a good nervewracking way to spend a little over an hour courtesy Columbia studios
1,Despite the fact that there were aspects of this film that I felt were not developed enough I enjoyed it and would recommend it to others Richard Gere and Diane Lane are great in their lead roles The basic premise of the film is that both were in the wake of broken marriages when they meet Both also are searching for healing Unexpectedly they find that they can help heal each other There were aspects of the film that I wished Id seen play out more where simple flashes merely suggested themes that my mind had to fill in the blanks on such as the apology to the bereaved widower and how Adrienne goes from feeling guilty about having slept with Paul to feeling okay with it soon after An opportunity for a tremendous love scene was lost when it was merely suggested they were going to make love with the hurricane coming But in the end the film left me feeling deeply appreciative of the relationship that my wife and I share And there were moments that moved me to the verge of tears So I have to say it is well worth viewing
1,The first mystery is to guess what Welles original film was like That makes this a real adventure  to see an incomplete skeleton and using cinematic forensics imagine the beautiful woman it once supported If you do you will both see and experience perhaps one of the best film mysteries ever As mysteries go the narrative is rather ordinary a simple diversion one jealous husband as red herring Whats rather miraculous is Welles placement of the story in an artificial eye seeing a dark dark multifaceted world The first real noir but even darker Its not an obviously twisted world unless you think about the camera What we can see firsthand is someone creating a vocabulary that would later become common For all the celebration Kane was a success because of the great drama and story The cameras eye was shocking but experimental Welles would go from there to explore the mystery narrative and the selfreference of Shakespeare with this eye Othello and MacBeth are both begun in this period and I consider them part of a single vision with this  The noir feel here hinges on the notion that people are not in charge of their lives even a little  they are manipulated by random factors in the environment So in telling this story Welles has to make the environment into a character Several characters as suspects in the mystery Thus we have the famous lighting blocking and angles we know and have since seen countless times And we have the deliberately closed sets the park yacht picnic area aquarium dock courtroom Chinese theater and funhouse I am certain that what was cut by the barbarians was lots and lots of external narrative dealing not with character but with these strange environments My own solution to the mystery is that the funhouse did it among the other characterenvironments introduced as suspects In other words the manipulation of Black Irish who we know from notes and one scene typing at the union hall was an aspiring novelist was neither a force of human conspiracy the park or the civilized version the courtroom nor of nature the picnic or the civilized version the aquarium Instead it was a matter of deliberate caprice by the gods for amusement This is of course a selfreference to what Welles is doing putting these people including himself through hell for our own caprice a matter underscored by the Peking Opera set with Welles doped up And of course leading to the funhouse where the environment directly tinkers with perception More about the selfreference surely there is conscious comment on his relationship with his soon to be exwife But I believe there is strong subconscious comment on his own taunting the environment in which he worked the studio environment Surely Welles was as much screwed with and in much the same way as his character And that screwing took the form of the murder of this film leaving the rotting corpse mentioned at the beginning of this comment That poor Rita comes from China ties up the whole thing the Chinese theater the expected rape from above the loss of the woman The investment in environment beyond all
0,I was very concerned about this film it was scheduled to play at a Jewish Film Festival and was reported to be very hostile to Israel while using clever humor and irony I was relieved that the film was not a diatribe however as a work of film it was deeply disappointing The film was full of random events some of which eventually connected most of which did not Some of the events were very clever and funny but some were merely random and pointless There are repeated scenes between two lovers where they sit in a car wordlessly and play some handholding game Perhaps in some cultures this is erotic but its like watching thumbwrestling After the third time it really became tiresome I have always found David Lynch to be gratuitously bizarre using strange stories and images to cause audiences to think that he is SO sophisticated that they dont grasp his work in fact there is nothing to grasp The same is true here the stories do not add up to anything and there is not much of a political point being made in one scene a boisterous Israeli soldier humiliates Palestinian drivers at a checkpoint Thats news I dont understand why this film has garnered controversy nor why it has garnered attention It is an inferior work and seeing it was a waste of time
0,This movie was exactly what I expected not great but also not that bad either In my opinion PG13 movies arent scary enough so thats why I already knew I was going to be bored throughout the entire film Sure there were scary things going on in the hotel room but nothing we all havent already seen I guess I didnt like it because I thought there were too many twists and turns happening it got old and repetitive I also didnt understand if all the things Cusack was experiencing in the room was real or not There is no explanation for any of the events that occurred The movie just drags on and when it finally does come to an end you want it to keep going because you are still waiting around for someone to tell you what the whole movie was about What I did like was the special effects Other than that there wasnt much enjoyment from it Maybe its just me but I thought this was below average
0,After watching the first 20mn of Blanchesorry I couldnt take more of it I have now confirmed she does not  Basically this movie is an insult to the real french actors participating in this farcical piece of junk It starts from a concept successfully used in French comedies Deux heures moins le quart avant Jesus Christ La Folie des Grandeurs a historical movie with anachronic tone  dialogues This can give brilliant results if supported by brilliant actors and a finesse of direction avoiding the dreaded heavy comedy stigma Unfortunately the horseyfaced Lou Doillon ruins everything and Blanche instead of a comedy just turns into an horror movie Horror to cinephiles who want to be puzzled and shocked watching fine actors such as Decaune Zem or Rochefort struggling in the middle of this gaudy burlesque kitchyprissy farce
1,Warning If the Coen Brothers or David Lynch define your taste in film disregard this review and move on Yes I borrowed the one line summary from the book about President Ronald Reagan but among other virtues this movie emphasizes the role that character plays in the lives of honorable human beings This film is full of honest decent people and they have integrity to spare In a word they have character A small nitpick Unless you know the history of WW II you probably dont know that from Captain Correllis arrival on the island to the fall of Mussolini 3 and onehalf years have passed The average viewer might think the romance was of the whirlwind variety That is not so The romance develops slowly which gives it both dignity and meaning The films deliberate pace may be the directors way of marking time Some reviews have criticized Cages Italian accent The Italianspeaking members of my family assure me that his accent is quite good  The history was right on the mark Yes the Germans turned against their Italian allies who for the most part were reluctant allies from the start If you find that shocking keep in mind that the French Mediterranean fleet was blown up by the British in 1940 just after Frances capitulation lest it fall in the hands of the Vichy government or worse the Nazis The depiction of the Italians as educated and cultured was a compliment to an educated and cultured civilization This film was beautifully photographed and its story was lyrical The script was not thoughtprovoking nor was it clever but here was a situation where confusion and cleverness were not needed nor would they have been appropriate  The story is tender and the message is uplifting The characters are honest brave earnest sympathetic and likeable Its a nice little film 810   
1,It is nice to see Suraj Barjatya back at what he is best atA story woven around a marriageIt feels nice to have a movie in which there is no single scene which you would avoid watching with your family Though the story is simple and does not contain any new elementsyou still like the moviebecause of the presentation performancesand actually the over all treatment Hats Off to Suraj The movie is about the fact that engagement leads to love The depiction of the changes in the way of thinkingbehaving once you get engaged is excellent Director has definitely given it much thought and actors have done it to perfectionThough the movie is slowyou dont mind itbecause you kind of get so much involved with the story that you just wanna continue watching the joy of this newly engaged couple As a typical RajShree stuff it has many sentimental scenes which are highly likely to make viewer burst into tearsspecially ladies But when you come out of the cinema hall you are very much satisfied and feel that the ticket was worth 
1,Holy Schnikey This Movie rocks The duo of Chris Farley and David Spade are great together My Favorite parts are Fat Guy in a little coat Oh my gosh Room service and more scenes that will be remembered for years to come This movie has a huge cult following I wonder why which proves that even eleven years after Chris Farleys tragic death and he still is popular He plays Tommy which will make you laugh every time you still watch it He is a great comedian and is missed Mr spade reminds me of Dan Akyroid while Chris Farley reminds me of John Belushi They done more than 2 movies together This Movie is a must buy and should be in every Snl fans collection
0,Im still laughing Not Im still asking my myself what the point was I barely got a chuckle this movie sucks It tries to be charming and touching but it turns out stupid I do not recommend it
0,I look around in the video store still in shock how Steven Seagal with his track record of Bad action movies can still have 3 movies hit the shelves in less than a YearAttack force being the 3rd no less promised the firsttime entrance into the Sci Fi Genre for our ever widening SeagalVisions of bad movie entertainment flashed before my gullible eyesSadly this is not the case one bit with no entertainment and a movie as bad as they come Seagal rebounded a tiny bit with the Trashybut enjoyable Shadow Man last time we saw himHowever Attack force has to be his absolute worst movie everDont argue for out for a KillTickeror even Black Dawn folksThis is the bottom of the Septic tank here Anyone who says this is Steven Seagals return to form should be forced to write a 100 page essay on the word Taste  Seagal is yet another agentIm a supreme badass yet again named Lawson wants revenge for the killing of his Team that leads him to a nefarious plot to distribute a really bad drug to the unsuspecting publicNot to mention the dealers are not from around here The whole Production from Directing to the acting is poorWas this movie shot in the DarkIts gotta be the most poorly lighted movie since Howling 2The action is terrible and very badly done The Producers have also unwisely decided to do what the fans hate the mostthrow in stunt double after stunt double and horribly dubbed Steven SeagalWho seems to show little enthusiasm hereCan ya blame him While it has been said that Attack Force was not the movie Stevie signed on fororiginally Harvesterand surely has to be better than Attack forceThe postproduction tampering has not made it more coherent and made Seagal look worseI feel bad for Directer Michael Keusch and writer Joe Halpin as they are gonna be judged forever for the illadvised production reshoots So Now This leaves Seagal in the impossible position to come up with something to atone for this messBut after seeing how bad Attack Force has turned out do we really want him to make another movie
0,A movie about dealing with the problems with growing up and being true to yourself Blue Juice is mind candy for those who like surfing and Cornwall Sean Pertwee is the real star of this film while the more famous Catherine Zeta Jones plays his girlfriend and Ewan Mcgregor plays his drug addicted pal For those who dont like surfing or Cornwall in the slightest youll find that it takes a long time before the movie even hints at being interesting The beginning is slow and spends too much time on long shots of only slightly interesting landscapes Plus too many main characters leads to most of them being one dimensional The plot is an interesting idea but because of the shallow characters you have no idea why they act in the situations theyre put in Only Ewan Sean and Catherines characters make this a film worth being on videotape which is why it was only released on videotape in the US after Ewan and Catherine reached mainstream fame
0,Now that Che2008 has finished its relatively short Australian cinema run extremely limited release1 screen in Sydney after 6wks I can guiltlessly join both hosts of At The Movies in taking Steven Soderbergh to task Its usually satisfying to watch a film director change his stylesubject but Soderberghs most recent stinker The Girlfriend Experience2009 was also missing a story so narrative and editing seem to suddenly be Soderberghs main challenge Strange after 20odd years in the business He was probably never much good at narrative just hid it well inside edgy projects None of this excuses him this present almost diabolical failure As David Stratton warns two parts of Che dont even make a whole  Epic biopic in name only Che2008 barely qualifies as a feature film It certainly has no legs inasmuch as except for its uncharacteristic ultimate resolution forced upon it by history Soderberghs 45hrslong dirge just goes nowhere Even Margaret Pomeranz the more forgiving of Australias At The Movies duo noted about Soderberghs repetitious waste of HD digital storage youre in the woodsyoure in the woodsyoure in the woods I too am surprised Soderbergh didnt give us another 25hrs of THAT somewhere between his existing two Parts because he still left out massive chunks of Ches revolutionary life  For a biopic of an important but infamous historical figure Soderbergh unaccountably alienates if not deliberately insults his audiences by 1 never providing most of Ches story  2 imposing unreasonable film lengths with mere dullard repetition  3 ignoring both true hindsight and a narrative of events  4 barely developing an idea or a character  5 remaining claustrophobically episodic  6 ignoring proper context for sceneswhatever we do get is mired in disruptive timeshifts  7 linguistically dislocating all audiences even Spanishspeakers will be confused by the incongruous expositions in English and  8 pointlessly whitewashing his main subject into one dimension Why at THIS late stage The Tshirt franchise has been a success  Our sense of claustrophobia is surely due to Peter Buchman and Benjamin VanDer Veen basing their screenplay solely on Guevaras memoirs So like a poor student who has read only ONE of his allotted texts for his assignment Soderberghs product is exceedingly limited in perspective The audience is held captive within the same constrained knowledge scenery and circumstances of the revolutionaries but that doesnt elicit our sympathy Instead it dawns on us that Ah Soderberghs trying to hobble his audiences the same as the Latino peasants were at the time But these are the SAME illiterate Latino peasants who sold out the good doctor to his enemies Why does Soderbergh feel the need to equate us with them and keep us equally mentally captive Such audience straitjacketing must have a purpose Part2 is more chronological than Part1 but its literally mindnumbing with its repetitive bushbashing misery of outlook and lack of variety or character arcs DelToros Che has no opportunity to grow as a person while he struggles to educate his own illdisciplined troops The only letup is the humour as Che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant revolutionaries some of whom violently lack selfcontrol around local peasants or food We certainly get no insight into what caused the conditions nor any strategic analyses of their guerrilla insurgency such as it was Part2s excruciating countdown remains fearfully episodic again nothing is telegraphed or contextualized Thus even the scenes with Fidel Castro Demián Bichir are unexpected and disconcerting Any selected events are portrayed minimally and Latinocentrically with Part1s interviews replaced by timeshifting meetings between the corrupt Bolivian president Joaquim de Almeida and US Government officials promising CIA intervention The rest of Part2s woods and dayfornight blue filter just exasperate the audience until theyre eyeing the exits Perhaps DelToro felt too keenly the frustration of many nonAmerican Latinos about never getting a truthful unspun history of Ches exploits within their own countries When foreign governments still wont deliver a free press to their peoplefor whatever reasonthen one can see how a popular American indie producer might set out to entice the notsowellread I may not be able to read or write but Im NOT illiteratecfThe Inspector General1949 out to their own local cinemas The films obvious neglects and gross oversimplifications hint very strongly that its aiming only at the comprehensions of the lessinformed WHO STILL SPEAK LITTLE English If they did theyd have read tomes on the subject already and critiqued the relevant social issues amongst themselveslearning the lessons of history as they should Such insights are precisely what societies still needand not just the remaining illiterate Latinos of Central and South Americayet its what Che2008 gleefully fails to deliver Soderbergh buries his lead because hes weak on narrative I am gobsmacked why Benicio DelToro deliberately chose Soderbergh for this project if he knew this Its been 44yrs hindsight about Guevara was sorely wanted its what I went to see this film for but the director diabolically robs us of that David Stratton writing in The Australian 03Oct2009 observed that while Part1 was uneven Part2 actually goes rapidly downhill from there charting Ches final campaign in Bolivia in excruciating detail which feels almost unbearably slow and turgid CheThe Guerilla aka Part2 is certainly no travelogue for Bolivia painting it a picture of misery and atavism The entire second half is only redeemed by the aforementioned humour and the dramaticyet tragiccapture and execution of the films subject The rest of this interminable cinema verite is just confusing irritating miseryshockingly for a Soderbergh film to be avoided at all costs It is bound to break the hearts of all who know even just a smattering about the subject210
0,Question how does a bourgeois director treat a subject like immigration  Answer by turning it into an existential alienation parable Yes were back in the early 90s just after the disintegration of the Eastern block and the subsequent flooding of immigrants in the European Union and what better way to deal with the subject than making a film about an existentially alienated middleclass journalist an existentially alienated upperclass politician his existentially alienated rich wife and so on In the background immigrants are asking for political asylum in an unnamed Greek village near the borders I guess that way Angelopoulos can show some social awareness while dealing with the existentially troubled upperclasses I mean honestly the scene where some topranking armyofficer curses his destiny cause he sent his daughter to study in London is enough to make you puke Anyway it cant be that bad Angelopoulos is a master of the cinematic art after all right  Wrong Its at this point when his mannerisms start getting too artificial sort of like a filtered image in Photoshop His usual tricks show up there are blurred windows blurred lights a weird wedding a walk by the rivershore and people with yellow watercoats Also Mastroianni breaks new ground for most sleepwalking performance ever Avoid really Go for his early films
1,How important is the director anyway In this film made in the politically tumultuous times of the late 60s where questions of social organization were prime conflicts asks that question by making a movie that turns the camera away from the action and only begs to reveal the director William Greaves It is an important work as it shows like no other movie shows the difficulties in blocking organizing and setting the scene it reveals the role of the crew something most directors frankly would like to disappear completely and that the invisibility of is essential for suspending disbelief and it also puts into consideration the role of performance and scripting and how they matchdont match reality and what that has to say about how the director ultimately influences reality if at all The documentary or pseudodocumentary or fictional narrative whichever you prefer via your interpretations of the themes has its brain in the overeducated overintellectual crew its guts in the lost performers struggling to understand the vague and ambiguous directions and its heart in the director who stands in as the desire to portray to represent to express without any idea how to do any of those things or why he wants to do it Its a film that purposefully repeats banalities just to see if they can become more than banalities Its a film that sometimes shows the multiple shots simultaneously just to leave the editing to the audience and also reveal how disturbingly different shots change perspective Its an important work and something that everyone interested in the industry and process of filmmaking should watch and understand It like many experimental films has no real massaudience appealits not for them Its for the industry and its for the 60s asking what to do with a groupeffort medium that still relies on a single voice and author PolarisDiB
1,This movie works because it feels so genuine The story is simple and realistic perfectly capturing the joys and anxieties of adolescent love and sexuality that mostall of us experienced during our teen years The actors are as natural as figures in a documentary but are as convincing and as charismatic as seasoned performers The dialogue is fresh and honest and thankfully not filled to the brim with cutesy pop culture references Also the cinematography is at once gritty and beautiful bringing the Lower East Side setting to life in a very tangible way On an artistic level I love this movie because it reminds me of great Italian neorealism films like The Bicycle Thief and La Strada Movies rarely feel as real as this does  or as Bicycle Thief did And the only other movie Ive seen that treats teen sexuality with the same level of seriousness is Elia Kazans Splendor in the Grass Writerdirector Peter Sollett deserves tremendous praise This film is quite an achievement On a personal level I am always glad to see a movie that treats members of ethnic America with love and respect As an ItalianAmerican I hate the way my own people come off in the cinema as racist womanizing criminal geniuses in irritatingly popular epics and my aggravation on this count makes me acutely sensitive to other groups and their awful silver screen representations Hispanics and Asians in particular seem cursed to playing villains in Westerns and action movies Good thing Gong Li didnt try to become famous in America Of course thanks largely to the rise of indie pictures and the influence of Miramax we are seeing a few more pictures about ethnic characters here and there  but Raising Victor Vargas is easily one of the best While I do really like My Big Fat Greek Wedding it is a refreshing change that Raising Victor Vargas is played straight with less exaggerated and broadlydrawn characters while still being very funny in its own right Finally Latino characters worthy of note I have a feeling that this is a film that will be remembered Of course now that he has made this wonderful picture about a family from the Dominican Republic I hope Peter Sollett gets around to making a movie about Italians soon   Marc DiPaolo
0,how does anyone keep on seeing horror movies after this one really this one its so bad that makes me sick and love horror movies but come on who could had remembered to do such a awful movie It as no historyits only a men who chases a bunch of teenagers because they take something from him  and what have they took goldits typical The movie is boring from the beginning until the end And what is Karen black who is a great actress doing in such a ridiculous movie like this but what can I say  I think everyone should see it because my opinion is my opinion may be you would like I dont think so but
0,What a shocker For starters I couldnt stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time It didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying The jerky camera movements were also annoying The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot And then theres the ending Im still not really sure what to make of it I guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid The case had a couple of those little award winnernominations symbols on it so I figured it couldnt be too bad I was wrong If you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf
0,You know  Ive been in some towns where the girls werent all that pretty In fact Ive been in some towns where theyre downright ugly But its the first time Ive been in a town where there are no girls at all I am sure the fans of great classic remember this phrase that belongs to Vin one of the TRULY magnificent seven from the first movie Now Id want to rephrase him here You know  Ive seen some movies where the plot isnt all that good In fact Ive seen some movies where the plot is terrible but thats first time in my life that I saw the film where there isnt any plot at all OK Maybe my above statement is little bit over the top but honestly how one can call the plot a crap that is going on in this movie The bad guy oh dont ask me to give you his name because I dont remember and his not even somehow close to Calvera whos name and character is unforgettable is trying to build the church in the name of his late sons that were killed in some battle and this bad guy is kidnapping poor villagers to force them to build the church first of all how big must be church to have to force hundreds of villagers to build it is it some Egyptian pyramid or something but OK lets stop here about the plot and absolutely forgettable character of a bad guy and lets say few words about The Seven itself Yul brynners good old Chris always calm always silent talking less but talking wise is gone unfortunately Oh no hes as calm as he was but now hes calmness are so fake that you just dont buy it imagine he meets a good old friend Chico who he must rescue after so many years and there is just a few hi Hello and not even handshake as far as I remember honestly it looks more like meeting of two strangers in some internet chat rather then meeting of Chris and Chico That makes new Chris more look like robocop or terminator rather then our beloved wise quickgun I wont stop here talking about other characters There simply arent ANY imagine if strong actor like Yul Brynner is so much fake forgettable then what will be other characters look like There still are some attempts to give us a background story for each one of them for example one is women favorite guy second is a man with dark past whos wife was raped and killed by indians and he since then is killing everyone and everything that is moving but non of these characters are making any sense or non of them can take your heart I remember I was a little child and when Oreilly Charles Bronsons character died in the first movie I was crying Here I just didnt care about each one of them even if whole of them with all the crew of the film would die it seems I wouldnt care more So please go and SEE THIS MOVIE I recommend it because you wont have the other chance to see something worse then it
0,As a devotee of Ms Frank I remember being so excited that the play was being remade for TV That is until I saw it This film is a prime example of how IMPORTANT casting is and how directing plays such an important part in creating the sense of purpose The casting of any CENTRAL role is CRUCIAL to a production of this sortshows like AUNTIE MAME and MAN OF LA MANCHA are totally dependent on the charisma of the lead actor And in the cast of this movie the whole thing is destroyed by the atrocious casting of Melissa Gilbert in the lead role There is not ONE SINGLE MOMENT that Ms Gilbert even comes close to inhabiting the sensitive mature spirit of Anne Ms Gilbert is whitebread throughout the movie the only time I was close to tears was during the reading of Annes most haunting line I still believe in spite of everything that people are truly good at heart this is spoken by Ms Gilbert so rushed so lacking in conviction that she might has well burped and achieved the same effect Film and dance legend Marge Champion was the dialogue coach for this production she should have refunded her salary Despite Ms Gilbert ruining DIARY other performances are satisfactory for the most part special kudos to Joan Plowright as Edith Scott Jacoby as Peter and Clive Reville as Mr Dussell Maxmillian Schell does not have the deeprooted soul and spirit as Otto as does the creator of the role on stage and filmJoseph Schildkraut but hes okay Doris Roberts and James Coco as The Van Danns are relatively superficial in their parts theyre shrill and bombastic but again only on the surface This COULD be due to the fact that the pacing of the project is way too rushedas noted in previous postings this film clocks in 45 minutes shorter than the film version the difference owing to the pauses for dramatic effect which apparently is necessary to propagate the appropriate MOOD for the story This is NOT mandatory viewing especially for youngsters learning about Anne Frank for the first time stick to the original film version and or even better the TV production of ANNE FRANK THE TRUE STORY starring Ben Kingsley which is the CLOSEST thing to capturing the heartbreak and reality of Annes situation ever filmed Note Especially appalling is the fact that Melora Marshall who plays Annes sister Margot is NOT included in the opening credits along with all the other members of The Secret Annex shes listed in the postcredits along with the actors playing Miep and Mr Kraler If I was Ms Marshall I would have SUED
0,I give this marriage 3 years and thats stretching it Adrianne Curry is fouled mouth spoiled controlling loud and her bi sexual past makes me laugh She tells Chris he has an image to protect and must avoid strip clubs He married her Chris has low self esteem and from a different time warp I have nothing against Adrianne Curry but this combination is not gonna have a happy ever after ending Her mother said he was an old rooster and thinks this is his last attempt to recapture his youth Here 2 very good people who are gonna end up in a nasty divorce I dont think his old  Brady Family is gonna fit into his new life I see them being shut out Chris said his friends were more important than his family The supported him and was there for him
0,SO THIS IS where Columbias head of their Short Subjects Unit got his Directorial start eh Yeahits none other than Mr Jules White who is credited or is it rather exposed as the Director of this entry into MGMs DOGVILLE Series Given cocredit as coDirector is one Zion Myers whose name is heretofore unknown to us Mr Meyers was no doubt the guy who controlled the fourlegged thespians and was responsible for training and acting In short he must have been the Dog Trainer on the set THE TITLE OF this comedy short is no doubt a play on the MGM feature of the same year THE BIG HOUSE which starred Chester Morris Wallace Beery Robert Montgomery and a stellar cast in support We must plead ignorance in regards to this title not having seen it up to this point SorrySchultz But there are many of the doggie gags that relate to what weve read about the movie not to mention some particular character specific gags For example we observed a canine convict who stststuttered and deducedcorrectly that the bowwow actor was mimicking character comedian Roscoe Ates We later crosschecked with the cast of THE BIG HOUSE and presto his name is there Brilliant deduction one fit for Holmes  Watson  THE PRACTICE OF lampooning popular features was already a tried and true practice in the realm of the comedy short It was one that seemed to draw no objections from the producers and copyright owners of the major films but rather quite contrarily received heaps of tassive approval After all imitation is said to be the sincerest form of flattery besides any producer would welcome even some seemingly irreverent parodying AS FOR THE movie itself we found it to be interesting in a sort of perverse manner Seeing so many of Mans Best Friends being so artificially animated into one long and boring sort of anthropomorphic gag seemed very tiring to we who make up the audience I mean just how many pooches were made to bark needlessly in order to achieve the illusion of talking  WHEN IT COMES to pets or Animal Companions as the Politically Correct crowd prefers we are quite eclectic favoring not only dogs but also cats hamsters and parakeets We dont enjoy seeing any animal exploited in such a nonfunnyextended play format AS INCREDIBLE AS it may seem the step that Mr Jules White made from MGMs Shorts to heading up Columbias 2 Reeler production would seem to have been not only a tep up in the area of finance but alo in the Artitic Content We never thought that being ProducerDirector for the likes of such luminaries as the 3 Stooges Andy Clyde and Hugh Herbert as well as some who certainly had seen better days such as Charley Chase Buster Keaton and Harry Langdon would be a step up cinematically IN CASE WE havent made our point yet were officially panning this one So view it at your own risk We warned you  NOTE  We read excellent accounts of both THE BIG HOUSE and the Laurel  Hardy sendup PARDON US Hal RoachMGM 1931 in both MR LAUREL  MR HARDY by John McCabe 1962 and THE FILMS OF LAUREL  HARDY by William K Everson 1967 Both books have our most enthusiastic endorsement NOTE  The Prison Picture became a Genre of its own all owing a debt to THE BIG HOUSE In PARDON US Laurel  Hardy Hal Roach and its Director did a first class spoofthe first of many for a Prison comedy became a required theme for so many a screen funny man to come
0,This movie is not as good as all the movies of Christ Ive ever seen And Im quite amazed that in this story Pilate wants to finish Jesus when the Scriptures as well the other movies state differently It lacks also a very important issue The Resurrection None of the other movies skip this very important part the faith of all of us Christians lies in this very event As Paul says in one of his letters If Christ did not rise from the dead our faith is vain A very impressive scene for me in this movie was seeing on the streets the remains of the palms that were used when Jesus entered Jerusalem  Finally and in opposition to my Jewish cocommentator Jesus WAS NOT a myth And as a matter of fact he was also a JEW There are plenty of documents relgious and secular that prove the existence of this extraordinary manor should I said God become a man that indeed changed mankind I strongly advise himgiven he is a historian to read about Flavius Josephus the most brilliant Jewish commentator of the 1st Century
0,I would give this movie 5 rather than 3 if it would be at least in time When ive seen it in first time it was just what you could wait from the work that is based not on the artistic abilities of the directors but on the idealistic or i would rather say idiotic habits of our Kazakhstan government Its a shame because Qazaqfilm was been shooting nice movies when it was not honoured by the name of Shaken Aimanov but it was actually ran by him The movies like Konec Atamana Kyz Zhibek or even Aldar Kose But after Mr Aimanovs death the production of quality movies went down almost dramatically in 10 years time there were very few films produced However in late 1980s Assa was shot it was a film about first organised crime groups in the big country one year later Mr Rashid Nugmanov shot another film with the costaring of the same actorsinger VTsoy at that time he was already a sovietRussian rock legend  the movie called Igla The Needle or something it was completely new somebody called that period as resurrection or a new Kazakh movie wave Unfortunately nowadays we do not have a quality movies our directors shooting movies on the french and Japanese financial support and thus movies are not for the public but for the authors professional critics some of them take a price on international author movie festivals but there a very few of them become a business asset products And again back to our nomads Such movies usually unpopular because of vast aspects The same effects was with Nikita Mikhalkovs Sibirski Cyrilnik about Russian tsars that was also shot on parities with foreign partners i think they were french or maybe British Nobdy liked it even in Russian public it become as a main topic of a comedians and comedy shows like KVN IMHO
0,Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer Vargas It looks very much like a TV movie not really exciting The only reason I bothered to see it was because Valentina Vargas was in it No real surprises here though it is nice to see Vargas Great looking Chilenian landscapes on display but Malcolm McDowells part is very small and doesnt add much to the movie Michael Ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts The chase scenes are standard fare
0,I do not see what is the whole deal about this movie Patricia Kaas sings yes and that makes the film charming but singing is not enough I mean if you want to get all benefits of this one go buy Patricias CD and enjoy The plot is simple if to omit the dreams the main characters seem to love each other instantly and as well instantly forget their other acquaintances Relationships appear almost mandatory and the little detective story thrown in just makes things worse What at first appeared to be a perfect movie ending is first screwed up and then comes out as just a dream I measure movies by how well I would remember them and for this one I already started to forget the details
0,If you are looking for a cinematic masterpiece this aint it If you are looking for one of those awful movies that are so horrible that they are actually good then this may be for you There are so many unintentional laughs in this film that it could almost be considered a comedy Lets start with the opening titles that say JackO and then add the word Lantern as if the viewer wasnt able to figure out the movie was about a pumpkin by the giant pumpkin shown on both the cover and in the opening scene of the movie After that the movie goes in about 20 different directions none of which make much sense Jacko is everywhere hes in peoples houses in the woods and yet he doesnt ever seem to do much of anything He does make a few kills but the long buildup to those killings is so poorly acted and constructed you almost wish Jacko would take out his rage on you the viewer Other than that the plot consists of poor acting gratuitous nudity and a ridiculous plot line The acting in this film is among the worst Ive ever seen in my 35 plus years of moviewatching The boy who is the lead in the film the directors son has about as much emotion as a corpse and just about all of the other actorsactresses are just as bad for numerous reasons especially the bugeyed lady with eyes bigger than saucers But having said all this if you take this for what it is that is a steaming pile of dung then you will get a few laughs from this movie What I also found amusing is that the makers of the DVD saw fit to release a 10th Anniversary Version of this movie as if the original wasnt good enough And someone actually had the idea of making a behind the scenes mini film which is also included in the 10th anniversary edition Im not sure whyIll give this 3 smashed pumpkins out of 10
0,This is simply put the worst movie I have ever seen It ranges from like 2 hours and the box art was totally misleading My friends and I rented it because we thought it would be a poor mans 300 You know to laugh at and make fun of No There is nothing funny about this movie only pain Then the movie starts up and they are speaking some sort of different language We think Oh its just the beginning But no from there the movie plummets and becomes more of like a super boring book you had to read in grade school where nothing literally happens for hours and the battle scenes rival those of 2 kids fighting on a playground Omit Cinematography and this movie belongs in trash compactor Movies like this will lead to the world we see in WallE which by the way was a good movie
